# Defining-the-urban-local-with-low-dimensional-manifolds-of-human-mobility-networks
Code for the paper "Defining the urban “local” with low dimensional manifolds of human mobility networks."
Here is a brief guide to the directory structure and its contents:

* `hm_as_manifold_v4`: This file contains the core code for the empirical analysis and manifold embedding described in the study.
* `_cons_smacof`: This module must be inserted into the `scikit-learn\manifold` library to enable the embedding functionality.
